# vue-calculator

Deployed to https://jenlky.github.io/vue-calculator/ and https://vue-3-calculator-test.netlify.app/

Github pages not working. It's displaying a white page because it can't access the JS and CSS scripts. More improvements to be made like switching eval with logic if I have the time.

Suggest to visit netlify site.
